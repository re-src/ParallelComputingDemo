# ParallelComputingDemo
Demo .NET console application to quickly compare parallel and synchronous cpu processing speed by calculating amicable numbers within a given range.

Currently features mainly Parallel.For() parallel processing and might profit from using Tasks as well in the future, also testing operations on the file system would be a nice addition.
